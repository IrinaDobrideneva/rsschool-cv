### About Myself  
A few years ago I had experience in software development. For 2 years I worked as QA Engineer. It so happened that I ended up in the marketing department and now I'm a marketer. But I understand that Iâ€™m not interested enough in this area and I want to return to IT. I already have some knowledge in HTML coding, so I decided to try to develop in this direction.
